# WOE-IV-feature-selection
# Version 3.17: 
This is the original version, in which I fixed some bugs and successfully ran the code, including handling some outliers.
# Version 3.18: 
Building on version 3.17, I further refined the outlier handling and implemented decision tree-based binning adjustments to make the binning process more reasonable.
